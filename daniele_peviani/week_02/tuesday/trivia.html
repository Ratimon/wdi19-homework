          <h2>Trivia</h2>

          <ul>
            <li>
              <span>Fact1</span>
              <h3>Olympic-level runner</h3>
              <p>He joined running clubs, becoming a competitive amateur and winning several races. In 1948, his best marathon time was 2 hours 46 minutes 3 seconds — only 11 minutes slower than the Olympic winning time that year.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <span>Fact2</span>
              <h3>Hippie</h3>
              <p>He was a hippie before his time. He was very casual in those days, and thought very scruffy. Had he lived a few decades later, he would have worn t-shirts and jeans every day. He also shared the left-leaning views of many of his Kings College compatriots and joined the Anti-War Movement in 1933.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <span>Fact3</span>
              <h3>Bad grades</h3>
              <p>He got bad to mediocre grades in school, followed by many complaints from his teachers. His English teacher wrote: “I can forgive his writing, though it is the worst I have ever seen” His math and science grades weren’t much better.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <span>Fact4</span>
              <h3>Other interests</h3>
              <p>Turing’s most notable work today is as a computer scientist. But he also studied physics, especially as a young man. He read Einstein’s theory of relativity as a teenager, and immediately filled a notebook with his own thoughts and ideas on the subject. He dabbled in quantum mechanics, a new field at the time, as well as biology, chemistry and neurology. </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <span>Fact5</span>
              <h3>Daisies</h3>
              <p>There is a sketch of Turing as a boy “watching the daisies grow” while the other children play. That sketch would foreshadow Turing’s ground-breaking work on morphogenesis, which became a completely new field of mathematical biology - a mathematical explanation of how things grow. One of his seminal papers was called “Outline of the Development of the Daisy.”</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <span>Fact6</span>
              <h3>Stutter</h3>
              <p>It is true that he had a bit of a stammer, something dramatic portrayals of Turing have exaggerated. He took his time finding the right words.A BBC radio producer had called Turing a very difficult person to interview for that reason.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <span>Fact7</span>
              <h3>Not so secret</h3>
              <p>The laws at the time prevented Turing from being openly gay, but he never kept his sexuality secret either. He was open with his social circles at Kings College in Cambridge, which was “an oasis of acceptance” at the time. When he was arrested, the first thing he said was he thought that this shouldn’t be against the law.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <span>Fact8</span>
              <h3>Hard working</h3>
              <p>The punishment for homosexuality was chemical castration, a series of hormone injections that left Turing impotent. It also caused gynecomastia, giving him breasts. But Turing refused to let the treatment sway him from his work, keeping up his lively spirit.</p>
