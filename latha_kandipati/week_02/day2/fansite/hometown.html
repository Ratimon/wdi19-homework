    <h2>Early life</h2>
    <p>Stallman was born to Alice Lippman, a school teacher, and Daniel Stallman,
      a printing press broker, in 1953 in New York City. He was interested in computers
      at a young age; when Stallman was a pre-teen at a summer camp, he read manuals
      for the IBM 7094. From 1967 to 1969, Stallman attended a Columbia University
      Saturday program for high school students. Stallman was also a volunteer
      laboratory assistant in the biology department at Rockefeller University.
      Although he was interested in mathematics and physics, his teaching professor
      at Rockefeller thought he showed promise as a biologist.

    <p>His first experience with actual computers was at the IBM New York Scientific
    Center when he was in high school. He was hired for the summer in 1970,
    following his senior year of high school, to write a numerical analysis program
    in Fortran. He completed the task after a couple of weeks
    ("I swore that I would never use FORTRAN again because I despised it as a
    language compared with other languages") and spent the rest of the summer
    writing a text editor in APL and a preprocessor for the PL/I programming
    language on the IBM System/360.</p>
