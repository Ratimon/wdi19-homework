// JavaScript Bank
// In this homework, you'll create a basic bank in Javascript. The bank has many accounts and the following capabilities that you need to write.
// Bank
// There is only one bank. This bank has an array of accounts. The bank needs a method that will return the total sum of money in the accounts. It also needs an addAccount method that will enroll a new account at the bank and add it to the array of accounts. There is no need to create additional functions of the bank to delete accounts, etc.
//
// The bank has many accounts. Accounts should be objects that all share a set of common functionality.
// Accounts
//
// Accounts have a current balance and owner's name. You should be able to deposit or withdraw from an account to change the balance.
//
// There is no need to write a user interface. Make sure functions return values -- you may also have your functions console.log() values to help you see your code working.
//
// You should write a basic story through a series of JavaScript commands that shows that the methods do indeed work as expected: add some accounts, show the total balance, make some deposits and withdrawals, show the new total balance.

var account =[{name: 'Jon Jones', balance: 958.30},
              {name: 'Steve Stephenson', balance: 2.85},
              {name: 'Bobby McBobberson', balance: 20.00},
              {name: 'Jacky Jackson', balance: 1500.23},
              {name: 'Max Power', balance: 69.69},]


  //    var a = Object.values(account.balance)


// var bankTotal = 0;
//
// var getBankTotal = function(b){
// for (var i = 0; i < b.length; i++) {
//   var a = b[i].balance;
//   bankTotal += a;
//   }
//  console.log('Bank total is now $' + bankTotal + ".")
// }
// var addAccount = function(nameInput, balance) {
//   push.account.nameInput.balance;
//  // sum of money in account array
// }
// function addAccount(nameInput, balance) {
//   var a = .make = make;
//   this.model = model;
//   this.year = year;
// }
